# Data Analysis on CSV Files (Sales Data)

This project focuses on fundamental data analysis using the Pandas library in Python.

## Objective

Analyze a sample sales dataset (`sales_data_sample.csv`) to derive basic insights using Pandas' core functionalities, specifically `groupby()` and `sum()`, and visualize the results.

## Tools Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** (Data Manipulation and Analysis)
* **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
* **Google Colab/Drive** (`gdown` for file handling)

## Key Analysis & Insights

The core analysis performed was to aggregate total sales revenue across different product categories.

### Analysis Performed:

1.  **Data Loading:** The `sales_data_sample.csv` file was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Aggregation:** The `.groupby('PRODUCTLINE')['SALES'].sum()` method was used to calculate the total revenue generated by each product line.
3.  **Visualization:** A bar chart was generated to visualize the top-performing product lines.

### Insight:

The resulting chart clearly shows which product line contributes the most to the total sales revenue, providing a quick, actionable business insight as required by the task.

## Deliverables

* `task_5_sales_analysis.ipynb` (Jupyter/Colab Notebook containing the full code)
* **Generated Bar Chart** (Visualizing total sales by product line)
